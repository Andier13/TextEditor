# TextEditor
A Notepad style app written in C/C++
This application was made in colaboration with @georgeoctavian18. I handled the user intercation and graphical components of the app, while he was in charge of the actual text processing components. Although we had our separate roles in the project we both helped each other where we could, working as a team.
